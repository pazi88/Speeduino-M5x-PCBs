/*
This is CAN library for STM32 to be used in Speeduino engine management system by pazi88.
The library is created because at least currently (year 2020) there is no CAN library in the STM32 core.
This library is mostly based on the STM32 CAN examples by nopnop2002 and it has been combined with few
things from Teensy FlexCAN library to make it compatible with the CAN features that exist in speeduino for Teensy.
Link to the nopnop2002 repository:
