# Revision 3.1

This rev 3.1 board is not recommended to be fully assembled by hand. For that use older THT revisions. Easiest way to get assembled PCB is to order one from PCBWay using this link: https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/Speeduino_compatible_BMW_M52_PnP_PCB_a3aa9a41.html

Note that the "EasyEda export" -BOM is just for reference. Not to be used when ordering boards.
